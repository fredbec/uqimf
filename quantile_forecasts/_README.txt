This folder contains the quantile forecasts generated by here("scripts", "make-forecasts.R")

- setting_combinations.csv 
	contains all setting combinations
	settings include the forecast source (AR, BVAR, IMF), the target (cpi and gdp), the error method (directional or absolute) and the estimation method (rolling window, expanding window, leave-one-out)
- quantile_forecasts.csv 
	contains all quantile forecasts generated by the settings in setting_combinations.csv
	quantile levels are evenly spaced (0.05 increments) between 0.05 and 0.95
- qufcs_directionalsymmetric.csv
	contains quantile forecasts that are symmetric while enforcing the same CI length as with the directional method 
	these were generated experimentally to investigate score differences between the absolute and directional quantile forecasts
