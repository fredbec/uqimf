length_ci_dirvsabs: 
	- illustrate that ci lengths are the same in the limit
	- illustrate why they are dissimilar in small samples [note: probably wrong]
	- small simulation study that shows that they are dissimilar for a normal distribution

length_ci_directionalvsabsolute
	- empirically checks the proportion of cases where the absolute intervals are longer (for the currently generated quantile forecasts in directory uqimf/quantile_forecasts)
