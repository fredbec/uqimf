This repo contains code to generate simple and transparent prediction
intervals for the IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts
[1](International%20Monetary%20Fund.%202023.%20\textit%7BWorld%20Economic%20Outlook:%20A%20Rocky%20Recovery.%7D%20Washington,%20DC.%20April.).
Central prediction intervals are generated at the 50% and 80% levels for
CPI inflation and real GDP growth, based on past forecast errors. See
below for documentation on which files the respective folders contain.

## Contents of the repository

The folders of this repository contain the following:

- `R`: All functions that the analysis is based on. Scripts that process
  data based on these functions are in `scripts`

  - `plot.R`: plotting files

  - `score.R`: functions to score quantile forecasts (coverage,
    interval_score, crps by sample)

  - `uqfc.R`: functions to generate quantile forecasts from past errors

  - `uqimf-package.R`: some stuff, as this is technically an R package

  - `utils.R`: miscellaneous small functions

  - `utils-manuscript.R`: miscellaneous small functions for manuscript

- `benchmarks`: benchmark forecasts and the scripts that generate them.

  - `point_benchmarks_processed.csv`: point benchmark forecasts (AR and
    BVAR model) as generated by `scripts/process-benchmarks`, see below

  - `quantile_benchmarks_processed.csv`: quantile benchmark forecasts
    (BVAR model) as generated by `scripts/process-benchmarks`, see below

- `data`: WEO and merged data

  - `weodat.csv`: tidy IMF WEO data, for G7 countries only
  - `point_forecasts.csv`: all point forecasts (weo and benchmarks),
    generated by `scripts/process-benchmarks`, see below

- `manuscript`: files to write manuscript. Abandoned now, in favor of
  `uqimf-manuscript` repository

- `oecd_data`: contains annual and quarterly truth data for inflation
  and GDP growth, as published by the OECD. Also contains R markdown
  scripts that check (and verify) compatibility of annual OECD truth
  values with annual IMF truth values

- `plots`: you get what you bargain for

- `presentation`: some files for the presentation of the project at the
  MathSEE Symposium

- `quantile-forecasts`: contains quantile forecasts as produced by
  `scripts/make-forecasts`, see below

- `scores`: Contains scores of forecasts in `quantile-forecasts` and
  BVAR benchmarks, at various levels of resolutions. Contains its own
  Readme file to explain what scores the different files contain.

- `scripts`: Contains scripts that process data based on the function in
  `R`

  - `toy-scripts`: small scripts to explore data

  - `plot-scripts`: scripts to generate plots

  - `download_data.R`: download IMF data

  - `make-forecasts.R`: generate quantile forecasts based
    (`data/point-forecasts.csv` to
    `quantile_forecasts/quantile_forecasts.csv`)

  - `process-benchmarks.R` process benchmarks to bring into compatible
    format with `weodat.csv`. Generates file that contains point
    forecasts from all sources in long format
    (`data/point_forecasts.csv`)

  - `process-weo.R`: short script to filter and process WEO data

  - `score-forecasts.R`: score quantile forecasts, those generated here
    and the benchmark BVAR quantile forecasts.

- `specs`: contains file to specify global settings (window length,
  etc.)
